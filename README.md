## Description
  
  Created using primarily node, the user will need to first locate and enter the file folder in the command line and run "npm i" to install all the necessary packages for the program. After doing so, the user can run "node server.js" to begin the application and be greeted with questions to compile data and track it in the database.

  My reason for creating this: To engage my mind and gain a better grasp on node, packages, and especially SQL; to learn.
